# Wunder
This is our entry to the hack of pi 2021 hackathon hosted on hackerearth.

# Proposition
We propose a new self-sufficient edtech model that isnâ€™t logistically bound to rely on masses for revenue generation and can truly offer specialised content tailored to specific segments.

# About the web-app
The platform is cv-backed, implementation in go-lang which enables us to validate the learner's progress.
Most of the site is static, currently for the prototype.
The dynamic component is the computer vision application in the back-end.
We plan to implement advanced eye-detection models for eye tracking, currently for the prototype we are using open-cv face-detection model
